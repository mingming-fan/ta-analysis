00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:21,186
I need to make sure the radio is off. Because I cannot hear anything and the display shows the current time 9:50 p.m. the radio is off.

2
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:35,935
 Now I will press and hold the first alarm button until the display flashes. 

3
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:47,205
 now I will press the hour button. I can see the hour is increasing. current time is in p.m., because PM light on the left side is on.  

4
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:57,364
 I will keep pressing the button until the p.m. light is on and the number is 8.

5
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:05,760
 Now I will press the minute button to increase the minute.

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:20,097
 Because I want to set the alarm at 8 o'clock so I keep increasing the minute until I see the time is 8 o'clock.

7
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:32,066
 Now the time changes back to the current time. What I need to do next is to set ringtone as buzzer.

8
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:51,294
 Now it uses the radio as the ringtone, because now the display shows a green dot on the music icon.

9
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:56,246
 Now I need to change the ringtone.

10
00:01:56,246 --> 00:02:18,712
 I wll press and hold the first alarm button until the display flashes. Then I will press the alarm button until the green light besides the alarm symbol is on.


11
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:22,011
 Now The ringtone is set.

12
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,873
 So, the task is now.
