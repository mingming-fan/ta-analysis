I need to make sure the radio is off. so now I can not hear anything and the display shows the current time nine fifty-four pm. So the radio is off. Now I will press the first alarm button, press and hold until the display flashes  now. now I will press the hour button to increase the hour. You can see the hour is increasing and it shows pm because the pm light on the left side is on. I'll keep pressing the button until the pm light is off and then the number is eight. Now I'll press the minute button to increase the minutes. Because I want to set the alarm at eight o'clock, so I keep increasing the minute. Now I see the time is eight o'clock. So the time is set. Now the time changes back to the current time. so what I need to do next is I need to set the ringtone. I need to set the ringtone to the alarm ringtone as a ringtone so now it shows a green dot on the music icon here which means now it uses the radio as the ringtone for the alarm. I need to change that. So, I'll press and hold the alarm button until the display flashes. Then I will press the alarm button until the green light shows besides the alarm symbol . Now the ringtone is also set. So the task me is down.
