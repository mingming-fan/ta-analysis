Okay so I want to copy two single sided sheets into two double sided sheets. um. okay. I'm opening the manual. register my product no thank you where's the table of contents don't see it yet. so flipping. lots of warnings ah table of contents basic user guide so I guess I want to look for photo copying. copy. here we go. copy a document page twenty one copy settings page twenty two copy options. copy multiple pages on both sides of paper.  that's what I want. so that's on page twenty four?  flipping through the pages. page thirty four. page twenty eight. twenty two. twenty four. okay. you must choose a two sided copy layout from the following options before you can start two sided copying. portrait. one sided landscape one sided short edge long edge. okay well. do the following. place the document face up in the A D F. I don't know what that is. also. the top of the printer looks completely different from the one in the picture. um I just see a flat bed scanner. where is this?  what? let me see if there's a description of the parts.  in here.  let's go back to the table of contents. um...control panel maybe no.  I don't think so. trouble shooting. appendix. supplies. utilities. let's just go to control panel or something. okay. fax WiFi LCD. no. I want to know what ah what the A D F what is the A D F I want to know what that is? so. no. on off. I don't see it here anywhere maybe let's go back to the print section and look at the first part of the print. quality. stack. sort. brightness. enlarge. reduce.  make sure you have loaded correct size paper in the tray.  I don't I don't see a tray. is this a tray? my. oh. I don't think I should pull that. I'm going to pull it anyway. let's see.  that's ink. no. that's so that. didn't like that. where do you put the paper in? in here right? maybe I think it comes out of there. this bottom bit okay.  say that you put it in here. this must be a different model.  what kind is this? D C P two five two zero w.  it's the first one. but it looks different. i guess the one in the picture is a different model. oh. wait. here is the one that I have. no. no that's different too. anyway. paper. I need printer paper potentially. oh bottom wait. no. i'm supposed to keep it there. I'm supposed to put the image paper in this tray I think. yes. face up. both of them? Place the document face up. and if you're copying multiple pages. we recommend you use the A D F. I don't know what that is still.  please say the A D F.  I think this must be the A D F. whatever that is. there is nothing says what it is. okay. well. I'm just going to see what happens when I put this paper in here face up. let's just. I don't think that's a good idea. okay let's just see what happens or you can place the document face down on the scanner glass. which would probably be easier. For M F C model. is this a M F C model? maybe. maybe I should just do that. I'm just gonna place it face down on the scanner. face down. scanner.  line it up with the letter size.  okay. press copy.  I see scan.  where's the copy? oh. copy. two and one ID copy. Do one of the following. press two sided or  press options to display the two sided options. let's do that. two sided. okay. two sided on please. two. two copies please. okay. this flashing. exit. let's start over. exit. stop. off. back. clear. nomething is happening. so let me press it again.  two in one ID copy. oh. no I didn't want to do that. no. I don't know what's happening. well it certainly copied it that's not what I wanted to do though.  let me just go back to options. options. stack. sort. brightness enlarge page two sided okay two sided one sided to two sided L or S. I read somewhere I want the long Edge flip I guess it doesn't specify. so yeah. one sided to two sided L. two copies. okay. maybe press start.  is it going to tell me to do the second one? one out of two? next page. yes. yes please. up for yes. set next page and press okay. okay.  okay. it still says one out of the two. okay copy one out of two I get it. I think this is right. now I see. no. no more pages.  please work. that was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  it seems to be working. I didn't really need the instructions for this. It kind of made things more difficult.
